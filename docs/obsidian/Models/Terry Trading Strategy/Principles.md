The central idea of Terry Trading Strategy(TTS) is to get strict math model, which will take into a—Åcount as much potentially influencing on price change variables as possible.
To achieve that process of developing strategy math model should be with following principles: 
1. **No constants** - all parts of the math model must be derived by mathematical models. Exceptions are constants set by the platform(e.g. [[Trading platform fee|platform fee]]) or appearing by themselves when deriving formulas. 
2. The development proceeds from the **general to the particular**. The initial point of the model development starts from the [[Central Formula]].
3. All truly **unknown market variables** should be treated as [[Probability Distributions]] rather than fixed values, and all operations involving them should be performed accordingly using [[probabilistic methods]].
4. All **manually defined** parameters (such as time intervals and limits) should be treated as functions optimized for performance rather than fixed values, with their optimal values determined through [[optimization methods]].
