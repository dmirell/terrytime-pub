[[Full Trading Cycle Model|Full trading cycle model's]] [[Trading cycle profit|profit]] depends on two variables: [[Trading cycle capital|cycle capital]]($C$) and [[capital multiplier]]($M$).

**Cycle capital** may be important multiplier doing *"risk management"* job: less risky -> bigger capital, more risky -> less.
Despite that **capital multiplier** is single parameter which affects does **profit** will be positive([[gain]]) or negative([[loss]]). So in simplified trading cycle model we may consider **cycle capital** as constant and focus on **capital multiplier**.

That means [[Trading cycle profit|profit]] formula for simplified version looks like:
$$
\begin{aligned}
C = 1, \quad D = M - 1
\end{aligned}
$$
which leads to:
$$
D \sim M
$$
